Adaptive diffusion simulation code
Giulia Fanti and Peter Kairouz, 2014

This code contains scripts for running simulations of adaptive diffusion over various data structures.
We provide code for two options:
1) Running the algorithm over trees
2) Running the algorithm over arbitrary graphs with specified adjacency matrices.



1) Running the algorithm over trees:

Call the following script:

python treeTrials.py <args>
    -t  trials          The number of trials to run. This requires an argument. 
                            Default = 1
    -a  alt             If you specify this argument, we will run alternative
                            spreading, which weights higher degree nodes more.
    -w  write_results   If you include this flag, we will write the results to
                            file. Must specify filename in code.
                            
It is currently necessary to specify the set of degree distributions and the
output filename in the code itself.

To change the degree distribution, change the pks list and the xks.
Each tuple in the pks is a discrete pmf. The corresponding list in xks is the
corresponding degree option. So if 
xks = [[2,4],[2,3]]
pks = [(0.5,0.5), (0.25,0.75)]
we will test two separate distributions. One over trees of degree 2 or 4 with
equal probability, and one over trees of degree 2 or 3 with probability 0.25
and 0.75, respectively.
